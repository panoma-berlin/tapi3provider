# tapi3provider

This project updates the tapi3provider.dll of the gjtapi project https://sourceforge.net/projects/gjtapi

The dll was converted to a visual studio 2015 project, some code changes were necessary (switch to secure functions were possible)

Some functions are still missing (Tapi3ReserveCallId for instance)

Feel free to add the missing parts
